            * local storage and session storage between main difference is  while data in localStorage it doesn't expire.

            * session storage data is cleared when the page session ends<br>

            * Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab. That page session is valid only for that particular tab.<br>
            * localStorage data for a document loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" .

                * Global Scope: Global variables are those declared outside of a block.<br>

                * Global  Scope:  A global variable has global scope.

            </a>
            <p class="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
              *  JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that JavaScript can do only one thing at a single point in time.
              The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. It creates the execution contexts, pushes, and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution phase.
              If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the function.s execution because the page hangs.

           *  When you declare a variable and dont initialize it to a value,or not declared at all.<br>
           *  A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.<br>
